# Calculating Base Value, Brand Power, and Audience Match for Touchline

This document outlines how to determine the `base_value`, `brand_power`, and `audience_match` values used by the Touchline logo detection and media valuation system. These values are crucial for accurately estimating the media value of sponsor logo detections.

## Understanding the Key Concepts

Before diving into the calculation methods, let's recap what each of these values represents:

*   **`base_value`:** This is the fundamental worth of a sponsorship for a particular company. It's the starting point for calculating media value and represents the inherent value of the sponsorship deal, independent of the quality of the logo's appearance in any specific media. Think of it as the "price tag" for a certain level of exposure.
*   **`brand_power`:** This is a multiplier that reflects the strength and recognition of a company's brand. A more powerful brand will generally command a higher media value for the same level of exposure. It's a measure of the brand's influence and market presence.
*   **`audience_match`:** This is a multiplier that reflects how well the target audience of the sponsor aligns with the audience of the media (e.g., a sports team's fans, a TV show's viewers). A better audience match means the sponsorship is more valuable because it's reaching the right people.

## Methods for Determining the Values

These values are typically determined through a combination of market research, industry data, and negotiation. Here's a breakdown of how to approach each one:

### 1. Determining `base_value`

The `base_value` is often a negotiated figure, but it should be informed by market data. Here's how to approach it:

*   **Market Research:**
    *   **Industry Benchmarks:** Research what similar companies are paying for sponsorships in comparable media. Look for industry reports and databases that track sponsorship deals.
    *   **Competitive Analysis:** Analyze what competitors are doing. If a competitor is heavily sponsoring a particular sport or event, that can give you a sense of the market value.
    *   **Sponsorship Tiers:** Many sponsorship deals are structured in tiers (e.g., gold, silver, bronze). Research the benefits and costs associated with each tier.
*   **Company-Specific Factors:**
    *   **Marketing Budget:** A company's overall marketing budget will influence how much they're willing to spend on sponsorships.
    *   **Strategic Goals:** What are the company's goals for the sponsorship? Are they trying to increase brand awareness, drive sales, or reach a new audience? These goals will affect the perceived value.
    * **Historical Data:** If you have data from previous sponsorships, you can use this to inform the base value.
*   **Negotiation:** Ultimately, the `base_value` is often a negotiated figure between the sponsor and the media owner.

**Example:**

*   A major sportswear brand sponsoring a top-tier sports league might have a `base_value` of $150,000 per year.
*   A smaller, regional brand sponsoring a local event might have a `base_value` of $10,000 per year.

### 2. Determining `brand_power`

`brand_power` is a measure of a brand's strength and recognition. Here's how to assess it:

*   **Brand Equity Studies:**
    *   **Brand Awareness:** How well-known is the brand? Use surveys, social media mentions, and web traffic to gauge brand awareness.
    *   **Brand Perception:** What is the public's perception of the brand? Is it seen as high-quality, innovative, trustworthy, etc.?
    *   **Brand Loyalty:** How loyal are the brand's customers?
*   **Market Share:** A company with a larger market share generally has a stronger brand.
*   **Financial Performance:** A company's revenue, profitability, and growth can be indicators of brand strength.
*   **Media Coverage:** How often is the brand mentioned in the media? Is the coverage positive or negative?
*   **Social Media Presence:** A strong social media presence can indicate a powerful brand.

**Assigning a `brand_power` Value:**

*   Use a scale where `1.0` represents an average brand.
*   A `brand_power` of `2.0` would mean the brand is twice as powerful as an average brand.
*   A `brand_power` of `0.5` would mean the brand is half as powerful as an average brand.

**Example:**

*   **Nike:** A very strong, globally recognized brand might have a `brand_power` of `1.8`.
*   **Adidas:** Another strong brand, but slightly less than Nike, might have a `brand_power` of `1.6`.
*   **A small, local brand:** Might have a `brand_power` of `0.5`.

### 3. Determining `audience_match`

`audience_match` assesses how well the sponsor's target audience aligns with the media's audience. Here's how to determine it:

*   **Demographic Data:**
    *   **Age, Gender, Location, Income, Education:** Compare the demographics of the sponsor's target audience with the demographics of the media's audience.
*   **Psychographic Data:**
    *   **Interests, Values, Lifestyle:** Do the interests and values of the sponsor's target audience align with the interests and values of the media's audience?
*   **Behavioral Data:**
    *   **Media Consumption Habits:** What other media does the target audience consume?
    *   **Purchase Behavior:** What products and services does the target audience buy?
*   **Surveys and Focus Groups:** Conduct surveys or focus groups to directly ask the target audience about their interests and preferences.
*   **Third-Party Data:** There are companies that specialize in audience data and can provide insights into the demographics, psychographics, and behaviors of different audiences.

**Assigning an `audience_match` Value:**

*   Use a scale where `1.0` represents a perfect audience match.
*   An `audience_match` of `0.9` means there's a very good match.
*   An `audience_match` of `0.5` means there's a moderate match.
*   An `audience_match` of `0.2` means there's a poor match.

**Example:**

*   A sportswear brand sponsoring a major sports league might have an `audience_match` of `0.9`.
*   A luxury car brand sponsoring a sports league might have an `audience_match` of `0.7`.
*   A brand of baby products sponsoring a sports league might have an `audience_match` of `0.3`.
